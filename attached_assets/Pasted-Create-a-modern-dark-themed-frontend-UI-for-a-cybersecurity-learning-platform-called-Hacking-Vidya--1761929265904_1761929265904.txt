Create a modern dark-themed frontend UI for a cybersecurity learning platform called “Hacking Vidya.”
Use React + TailwindCSS (frontend only, no backend or database).
The site should look professional, futuristic, and hacker-inspired — similar in vibe to Hack The Box or TryHackMe — with glowing neon green accents and smooth motion effects.

You may also add creative UI ideas, animations, or improvements that fit the hacker theme (e.g. terminal effects, neon particle backgrounds, micro-interactions, cool hover transitions).
